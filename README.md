# metis

I was having problems building ElmerFEM as a flatpak because at the time I was building it, the university website hosting the source tarball for the version of metis that was known to work in the flatpak build seemed to be down. Just out of laziness to edit the patches to get it building with a newer version of metis from elsewhere, I just decided to grab a tarball off sourceforge and make it into this git repo.... of course I checked the sha256sum to verify it first.
